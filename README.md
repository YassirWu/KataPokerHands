# KataPokerHands

This is my implementation of the Kata Poker Hands from this link https://codingdojo.org/kata/PokerHands/

In first, install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

To play, launch this command:
```bash
yarn play
```
It will build the project and start the game on the terminal. You have to write the card desk of the two players.
Please respect this structure, otherwise it will throw an exception:
2H 3D 5S 9C KD


If you want to run the unit tests:
```bash
yarn test
```
